title: "Adding UI Components"
---

The application comes pre-configured with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/); a
set of open-source, accessible components built with [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and Tailwind.

It comes with a [CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) that can be used to easily add components to your application.
You can see the template comes with two components made this way already, [button](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/application/components/button.tsx)
and [checkbox](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/application/components/checkbox.tsx).

From the application directory, run the following command to add a new component:

```bash
yarn add-component
```

This will ask you which component(s) from all the available components you would like to add. You can add as many as you
like, and they will be added to the `components` directory; where they become fully customizable.
