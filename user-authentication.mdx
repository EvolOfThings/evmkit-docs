title: "User Authentication (SIWE)"
---

You may need to know a user's wallet address on the server-side, for use cases such as restricting pages to
users who own an NFT or for [signature-based minting](https://portal.thirdweb.com/glossary/signature-based-minting).

Providing the user's wallet address from the client is not secure, as it can be spoofed. Instead, you can use
the [EIP-4361 Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) standard to ask the user to
prove ownership of their wallet address by signing a message, and then verifying the signature on the server-side.

EVM Kit uses [thirdweb Auth](https://portal.thirdweb.com/auth) to provide SIWE functionality.
