title: "Writing Smart Contracts"
---

Smart contracts are located in the `/contracts` folder.
The template comes with a barebones `Greeter` smart contract, written in Solidity.

The general flow you&rsquo;ll follow when writing smart contracts is:

1. `yarn build`: Compile your smart contracts with Hardhat.
2. `yarn test`: Run your smart contract tests with Hardhat.
3. `yarn deploy`: [Deploy](/deploying-contracts) your smart contracts to any EVM chain from the browser.

## OpenZeppelin & thirdweb Solidity SDK

[thirdweb&rsquo;s Solidity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity) comes pre-installed for you to use and inherit from.

This includes the logic for the most common patterns and standards in the EVM ecosystem; including
[ERC20](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/base-contracts/erc20base),
[ERC721](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/base-contracts/erc721base),
[ERC1155](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/base-contracts/erc1155base),
[staking](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/base-contracts/staking/staking721base),
[permissions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/extensions/permissionsenumerable), and more.

[Open Zeppelin contracts](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) is a dependency of thirdweb&rsquo;s Solidity SDK, so a number of the Open Zeppelin contracts are also available for you to use via
the thirdweb Solidity SDK; although you can install Open Zeppelin contracts directly if you prefer.
