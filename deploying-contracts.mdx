title: "Deploying Smart Contracts"
---

The thirdweb CLI comes with a command called `deploy`; accessible from the `/contracts` directory by running
the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command will perform the following:

1. Find all smart contracts from the `/contracts` directory
2. Compile the smart contracts using Hardhat
3. Generate a URL for you to deploy them via the browser

From the browser, you can choose any EVM chain to deploy to or input the information for a custom chain using the thirdweb dashboard.

## Using A Local Network (Optional)

When you're testing out your smart contracts, you can use free test networks like Polygon's Mumbai,
Ethereum's Sepolia, or any other EVM-compatible test network.

These are great for testing, but sometimes they're a little slower than you'd like.

You might prefer using a [local network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview) that allows you to deploy the smart contracts
to your local machine and still connect to them from the `/application` directory. The local network has a few benefits:

- Near instant transaction times
- Easy access to test funds
- Faster iteration cycles

The suggested approach to this is to open a _third_ terminal in your IDE; responsible for running your local network, by running the following command (from the `/contracts` directory):

```bash
yarn run-node
```

This will allow you to deploy smart contracts to your local node, by using the `yarn deploy` command, and selecting `Localhost` as the chain to deploy to
on the thirdweb dashboard.
