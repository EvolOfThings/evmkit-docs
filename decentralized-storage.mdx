EVM Kit includes functionality to easily upload to, and render files from IPFS via a gateway; powered by
[thirdweb Storage](https://portal.thirdweb.com/storage).

The app comes with a [DecentralizedStorage](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/application/components/demo/DecentralizedStorage.tsx)
component to demonstrate how to upload to and render files from IPFS.

## Upload (and pin) Files to IPFS

Use the [useStorageUpload](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usestorageupload) hook to upload files to IPFS.

## Render Files from IPFS

Use the [MediaRenderer](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.mediarenderer) component to render _any_ type of file from IPFS; including
images, videos, audio files, 3D models, and more.
