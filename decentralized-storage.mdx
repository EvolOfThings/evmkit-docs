title: "Decentralized Storage (IPFS)"
---

EVM Kit includes functionality to easily upload to, and render files from IPFS via a gateway; powered by
[thirdweb Storage](https://portal.thirdweb.com/storage).

The app comes with a [DecentralizedStorage](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/application/components/demo/DecentralizedStorage.tsx)
component to showcase how to upload to and render files from IPFS.

## Upload (and pin) Files to IPFS

Use the [useStorageUpload](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usestorageupload) hook to upload files to IPFS.

```jsx
import { useStorageUpload } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const { mutateAsync: upload } = useStorageUpload();
}
```

## Render Files from IPFS

Use the [MediaRenderer](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.mediarenderer) component to render _any_ type of file from IPFS; including
images, videos, audio files, 3D models, and more.

```jsx
import { MediaRenderer } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function Home() {
  return (
    // Any URL that points to media (IPFS URI, HTTP URL, etc.)
    <MediaRenderer src="ipfs://QmV4HC9fNrPJQeYpbW55NLLuSBMyzE11zS1L4HmL6Lbk7X" />
  );
}
```
